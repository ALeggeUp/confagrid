The founder of ‘[Girls Who Code](http://girlswhocode.com/)‘ Reshma Saujani was on The Daily Show February 1st.  The link being published won’t work for most in Canada, so if you’re in Canada like me you’ll need to find it at The Comedy Network instead.

I’ve linked to the video for reference: [The Comedy Network – Video 798314](http://www.thecomedynetwork.ca/Shows/TheDailyShow?vid=798314)

The interview starts just after 14:28 if you want to skip ahead.
