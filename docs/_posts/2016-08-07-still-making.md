It’s been too long since I’ve posted and I feel horrible about it.  Not that I think anyone else noticed, or that anyone else is concerned with what I’m doing but I was all excited about the roll I was getting on and the fact that I feel that I have stalled is a setback.

When I look back on the last couple of months and try to figure out why I haven’t been working on any little projects that I could blog about I realized it was because I was working on a couple of big projects.

First of all my wife and I decided to build a patio on a pretty tight timeline which ended up taking a good chunk of the small amount of free time we usually have on weekends.

We’re really happy with the way it turned out and it was satisfying completing it before our self-imposed deadline.  It wasn’t the type of thing I would normally blog about because it wasn’t of the normal technical nature of what I intended to blog about but it was a large project of making something by hand so maybe I should have.  I didn’t document the process in the same way that I normally do with a project that I intend to blog about, so I would have trouble putting something together, but if anyone has any questions about the process I’d be happy to answer them.

The other project that took up the rest of my time for different reasons was a custom privacy screen that I designed for behind my BBQ on the deck.  We had the idea to make a custom screen a couple years ago but kept running into roadblocks on how to do it and where to get it done.  Since we were already working on finishing up a project in the back yard for a specific date I decided to look into it again and when it looked like we might be able to get it done we hit the gas and made it happen.

I ended up learning a lot about how different CNC systems work, what their limitations are and how confused customer service people can look when you ask them something they’ve never been asked before.

I think I can put together some good information on everything I had to go through to get the screen done, I’ll try to put that together now that the big projects are complete.

Hopefully I can knock off a few smaller projects now and get back to a better pace, but in the mean-time if I’m not blogging about making something it’s probably because I’m busy making something.
