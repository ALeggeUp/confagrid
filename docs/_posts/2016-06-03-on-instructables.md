I have used [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/) many times, learned many things and have been inspired and figured that it was about time that I gave back.

My last hack is now posted as [Lawn Mower Charger Connector Hack](http://www.instructables.com/id/Lawn-Mower-Charger-Connector-Hack/) on Instructables and Iâ€™ve even received my first comment!

Please take a look and let me know what you think.
