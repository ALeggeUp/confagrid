I had to dust off some HTML and JavaScript skills, but I found a nice clean template I liked, a cool parallax slider and glued them together to come up with something Iâ€™m happy with.

Mostly just a landing page so far, but will hopefully add some content different than the blog and more details on projects as they get more polished.

Please take a look and let me know what you think!
