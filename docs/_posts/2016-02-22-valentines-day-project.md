Wow, this week flew by.  I didn’t get a chance to blog about our last project, the valentine’s day heart.

We got the “Love Tester” kit from Sayal electronics, it was the most expensive kit we’ve worked on yet, not because it was the best quality or had the most parts, but just because we’re suckers and bought a heart related kit close to Valentine’s day…  Oh well.

I thought it would be a good opportunity to get my other daughter involved since it would be for “mommy” and I didn’t want any upstaging or thoughts of being left out.  She’s almost eight and usually up for anything, but she was pretty nervous about holding the soldering iron, but after some time she worked her way up to it and made her first solder joint.

It wasn’t too complicated of a kit, but there were a lot of points to solder and it was going to take a little skill and time, so big sister came in to save the day and finish the job.  It ended up taking about two hours to complete, but it worked great and was a fun project to work on together.
