I just started the resources page called [A Journey to the PowerShell Citadel](/powershell-resources). It's a
maintained list of PowerShell resources split into 3 main parts / levels:

- **Novice:** Learn the most basic parts of powershell and know where to find the fundamental docs.
- **Acolyte:** Increase your knowledge in advanced topics of PowerShell and tools
- **Maester:** Get in touch with others, continue studying an share your knowledge.
