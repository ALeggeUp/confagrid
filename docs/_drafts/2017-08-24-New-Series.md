Hey Powershell friends,

I'm thinking about starting a new series called **The Debugger Tales**.

In this series I would like to share my experience in solving unique powershell problems. The problems itself will be
practical examples which could appear in your daily business. With this knowledge you should easily avoid doing the same mistakes I did :D

The first post will cover a problem caused by profile related environment variables in scheduled tasks:

What do you think?
